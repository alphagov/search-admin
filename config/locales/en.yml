# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    completion_denylist_entry_import_denylist_csv_data_html: |
      <p>One line per new denylist entry as 1-3 column comma separated values in the following format:</p>
      <code>phrase[,match_type[,comment]]</code>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>foo</code></li>
        <li><code>foo,exact_match</code></li>
        <li><code>foo,contains,This is a comment</code></li>
        <li><code>foo,,I don't have a match type - only a comment</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The tab character can be used as a separator (for example, for data copied from a spreadsheet), but if used for any entry, it must be used for all entries. The match type is optional and defaults to exact_match. You can use commas in the comment but you need to "quote" it as you would in a CSV file.</p>
